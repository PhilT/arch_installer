   This document will guide you through the process of installing Arch
   Linux from the live system booted with the official installation image.
   Before installing, you are advised to skim over the FAQ. See Beginners'
   guide for a highly detailed, explanatory installation guide.
   Category:Getting and installing Arch contains several more installation
   guides for specific cases.

   The community-maintained Arch wiki is an excellent resource and should
   be consulted for issues first. The IRC channel
   (irc://irc.freenode.net/#archlinux), and the forums are also available
   if the answer cannot be found elsewhere. Also, be sure to check out the
   man pages for any command you are unfamiliar with; this can usually be
   invoked with man command.

Download

   Download the new Arch Linux ISO from the Arch Linux download page.
     * A single image is provided which can be booted into an i686 and
       x86_64 live system to install Arch Linux over the network. Media
       containing the [core] repository are no longer provided.
     * Install images are signed and it is highly recommended to verify
       their signature before use: this can be done by downloading the
       .sig file from the download page (or one of the mirrors listed
       there) to the same directory as the .iso file and then using
       pacman-key -v iso-file.sig.
     * The image can be burned to a CD, mounted as an ISO file, or
       directly written to a USB stick. It is intended for new
       installations only; an existing Arch Linux system can always be
       updated with pacman -Syu.

Installation

  Keyboard layout

   For many countries and keyboard types appropriate keymaps are available
   already, and a command like loadkeys uk might do what you want. More
   available keymap files can be found in /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/ (you can
   omit the keymap path and file extension when using loadkeys).

  Partition disks

   See partitioning for details.

   If you want to create any stacked block devices for LVM, disk
   encryption or RAID, do it now.

   If you are using (U)EFI you will most probably need another partition
   to host the UEFI System partition. Read Create an UEFI System Partition
   in Linux.

  Format the partitions

   See File Systems and optionally Swap for details.

  Mount the partitions

   You must now mount the root partition on /mnt. After that, you should
   create directories for and mount any other partitions (/mnt/boot,
   /mnt/home, ...) and activate your swap partition if you want them to be
   detected by genfstab.

  Connect to the internet

   A DHCP service is already enabled for all available devices. If you
   need to setup a static IP or use management tools such as Netctl, you
   should stop this service first: systemctl stop dhcpcd.service. For more
   information read configuring network.

    Wireless

   Run wifi-menu to set up your wireless network. For details, see
   Wireless Setup and Netctl.

  Install the base system

   Before installing, you may want to edit /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist such
   that your preferred mirror is first. This copy of the mirrorlist will
   be installed on your new system by pacstrap as well, so it's worth
   getting it right.

   Using the pacstrap script we install the base system.
# pacstrap /mnt base

   Other packages can be installed by appending their names to the above
   command (space seperated), including the boot loader if you want.

  Configure the system

     * Generate an fstab with the following command (if you prefer to use
       UUIDs or labels, add the -U or -L option, respectively):

# genfstab -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

     * chroot into our newly installed system:

# arch-chroot /mnt

     * Write your hostname to /etc/hostname.

     * Symlink /etc/localtime to /usr/share/zoneinfo/Zone/SubZone. Replace
       Zone and Subzone to your liking. For example:

# ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Athens /etc/localtime

     * Uncomment the selected locale in /etc/locale.gen and generate it
       with locale-gen.
     * Set locale preferences in /etc/locale.conf.
     * Add console keymap and font preferences in /etc/vconsole.conf
     * Configure /etc/mkinitcpio.conf as needed (see mkinitcpio) and
       create an initial RAM disk with:

# mkinitcpio -p linux

     * Set a root password with passwd.
     * Configure the network again for newly installed environment. See
       Network Configuration and Wireless Setup.

  Install and configure a boot loader

   See Boot Loaders for the available choices.

  Unmount and reboot

   If you are still in the chroot environment type exit or press Ctrl+D in
   order to exit. Earlier we mounted the partitions under /mnt. In this
   step we will unmount them:
# umount -R /mnt

   Now reboot and then login into the new system with the root account.

Post-installation

   See General recommendations for system management directions and
   post-installation tutorials like setting up a graphical user interface,
   sound or a touchpad.

   For a list of applications that may be of interest, see List of
   applications.
